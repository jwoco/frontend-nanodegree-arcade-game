Instructions on playing the game
=================================

Game objective: Player moves to water without bumping into a bug (enemy).

Moving the player: Use the arrow keys to move up, down, left, and right. One click on an arrow key moves the player one jump.

Rules:

- If the player reaches the water, a "Success" message is displayed and the player's Score is increased by 1. The Score is shown with the Success message. The player is reset to the start position and you can try again.

- If the player bumps into a bug, or a bug bumps into a player, a "Fail" message is displayed and the game and score are reset. You can try again.

- The player cannot move off the screen. If you move to the left, right, or bottom borders, the player will "bounce" off the border.
